    InstanceVariables:
        private String[][] boxNumbers
        private String[][] blank
        private final String DIV_LINE = "|----|----|----|----|"
        private int columns
        private int rows
        private final String ANSI_RESET = "\u001B[0m"
        private final String ANSI_BLUE = "\u001B[34m"
        private String sequence


    Constructor:
        MemorySequence(int c, int r)
            initialize and set the arrays of boxNumbers as well as blank according the the number of columns(c) and rows(r) given
        MemorySequence()
            initialize and set the arrays of boxNumbers as well as blank to their default values (4x4 grid)

    Methods:
        private printBox(String[][] array) return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the values of the 2D array in the parameter


        emptyBox() return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the numbers in them

        numBox() return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the numbers in them

        lightBox() String return type
            will cause one of the tiles (random) to "light up" (it will just be colored text)
             ** in the memory sequence game I will have to indicate which box is chosen
             ** will also save the sequence so the user can input it
