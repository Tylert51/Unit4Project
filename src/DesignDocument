    InstanceVariables:
        private String[][] boxNumbers
        private String[][] blank
        private final String DIV_LINE = "|----|----|----|----|"
        private int columns
        private int rows
        private final String ANSI_RESET = "\u001B[0m"
        private final String ANSI_BLUE = "\u001B[34m"
        private static ArrayList<String> sequence = new ArrayList<String>()
        private static ArrayList<String> userInputAns = new ArrayList<String>()
        private int score


    Constructor:
        MemorySequence(int c, int r)
            initialize and set the arrays of boxNumbers as well as blank according the the number of columns(c) and rows(r) given
        MemorySequence()
            initialize and set the arrays of boxNumbers as well as blank to their default values (4x4 grid)

    Methods:
        private printBox(String[][] array) return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the values of the 2D array in the parameter


        emptyBox() return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the numbers in them

        numBox() return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the numbers in them

        lightBox() String return type
            will cause one of the tiles (random) to "light up" (it will just be colored text)
             ** in the memory sequence game I will have to indicate which box is chosen
             ** will also save the sequence so the user can input it

        public boolean gameRunning()    boolean return value
            will return if the game is still running (when the user gets the sequence wrong the game is over and that is when this value is false)

        public static void setScore()   void return value
            will set the score to the current length of the sequence if the user gets it correct

        public static void setUserInputAns(ArrayList<String> userAns)      void return type
            will set the sequence that the user enters to the ArrayList called userInputAns

        toString()    returns a String
            **to be decided


Main Runner Class:
    ask user if they want to play competitive or practice mode
        if play practice, they can choose between setting the size of their own grid or using a default 4x4 grid
            they will also be met with a question if they want to practice a certain sequence length or just play the default way
        will display the grid with all the numbers in them to show the user which box is which
        then display a sequence with a length of one (default way)
        if they get it correct, the sequence length increases by one (default way)
            will print their score at the end
            will print their personal best as well based on the name
        if they select their own way, they are asked to input the length of the desired sequence and a sequence of that length will be displayed
            will print if they got it correct or not

        if they play competitive they will only be able to play default play (sequence increases by one each round)
            they will be able to save their score with their name and get a chance to be in the leaderboard (top 5)


    methods:
        public static boolean inRange(int num, int lower, int higher)
            will return if the number is in between the lower and higher numbers
