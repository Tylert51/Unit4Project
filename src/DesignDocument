MemorySequence Object:

Box Layout:

    | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |


    InstanceVariables:
        private String[][] boxNumbers
        private final String DIV_LINE = "|----|----|----|----|"


    Constructor:
        MemorySequence()
            initialize and set the arrays of boxNumbers and blank to their respective values

    Methods:
        private printArray(String[][] array) return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the values of the 2D array in the parameter


        emptyBox() return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the numbers in them

        printBox() return String
            will print out the memory tiles with the numbers in them

        lightBox() void return type
            will cause one of the tiles (random) to "light up" (it will just be colored text)
             ** in the memory sequence game I will have to indicate which box is chosen
